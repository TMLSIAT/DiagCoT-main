    "report": "findings : pa and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position . comparison is made with the next preceding portable ap single view chest examination of  . the patient is now examined in standing upright position . there is status post sternotomy and significant cardiac enlargement as before . within the cardiac shadow metallic portions of three different valve prostheses can be identified . one is a circular metallic ring in the position of the aortic valve the second one a similar oval-shaped ring formation in the mitral valve position and the third one an open circle rather typical for a tricuspid valve annuloplasty . correlating the position of these valves to the outer contours of the heart one can state that there is remaining marked enlargement of the left atrium but the increased distance between the tricuspid valvuloplasty and the anterior heart border speaks much in favor of a right ventricular enlargement as well as an enlarged right atrium . prominence of the ascending aortic contour is moderate . the pulmonary vasculature is presently not congested and on previous portable examination identified edema pattern as well as evidence of right-sided pleural effusion has normalized . no new parenchymal abnormalities are seen and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area . again observed is a fractured second rib in the left apical area apparently the result of previous sternotomy and intrathoracic cardiac intervention . when comparison is extended to the next preceding pa and lateral chest examination of  the patient is in better condition now as the cardiac enlargement has regressed and the pleural effusion has been absorbed completely . impression : marked improvement of chf in patient with history of triple valve replacement ."
